				<p class="infoMain"> The battle royale genre is becoming an extremely popular genre in the gaming community. The genre is a mix of both scavenging/survival, and last man standing type of game play. A large number of individual players, or a small team, gets deployed to map where they must try to be the last one alive by the end of the game. Players start off the matches with usually no equipment and must scavenge items from around the map, and use those resources to eliminate other players. Most BR games, if not all, follow this pattern of gameplay:

				<ol id="standardGameplay">
					<li name="playSteps">Choose landing area.</li>
					<li name="playSteps">Find equipment and weapons.</li>
					<li name="playSteps">Eliminate other players.</li>
					<li name="playSteps">Be the last man, or team, standing.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p class="infoMain"> While gameplay does differ from game-to-game, this is the general formula that all BRs follow.<p>
				
				<h1> History of the genre</h1>
					<p class="infoMain"> The battle royale genre technically started in 1999 when the novel Battle Royale was released. This Japanese novel tells the story of a group of high school students who are placed on an island and forced to kill one another in order to be the last one standing. However, it wasn't until "The Hunger Games" for the genre to really be brought into the spotlight. 
					</p>
				
					<p class="infoMain">The first BR game was introduced as a mod designed for the game ARMA 2/DayZ. The creator of this mod, Brendan Greene, would then move on to be a consultant for a game called H1Z1. H1 was a survival game that offered limited time modes (LTMs). When Greene was brought on as a consultant the team decided to make a side mode to the game called Battle Royale. However, this mode became more popular than the original game mode and the developer team ended up splitting up and created a stand alone BR H1Z1: King of The Kill. H1 was a successes, but this was primarily due to the fact that there were not any other BR type games out at this time. Eventually Greene would go on to develop his own game that would known as PlayerUnkowns: Battlegrounds (PUBG). PUBG took the gaming world by storm selling over 13 million copies in only 6 months. As the genre becomes more popular, game developers are starting to create their own unique BR games. As the number of BR games rise, the question is which game will be the last one standing?
